      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>We combine three revenue streams to create a resilient model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware sales</strong> — one-time revenue from solar-hybrid installations and battery units.</li>
        <li><strong>Software & Subscriptions</strong> — recurring revenue from our energy-management platform, analytics, and predictive maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Services & Financing</strong> — installation, extended warranties, and pay-as-you-go financing programs to lower customer adoption barriers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unit economics (example)</h3>
      <p>Average system cost to customer: USD 8,500</p>
      <p>Average gross margin per system: 38%</p>
      <p>Average recurring monthly ARR per system (software + maintenance): USD 18</p>
